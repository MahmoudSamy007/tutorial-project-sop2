# Personal Portfolio Landing Page

This is a simple responsive landing page built using **HTML** and **CSS** as part of my web development learning journey.

## 💡 Purpose

The project was developed during my practice of basic web design principles. It's one of the first practical steps I took to understand the structure and styling of websites. This knowledge forms the foundation for my bigger goal — mastering **Cybersecurity** and **Web Penetration Testing**.

## 📺 Tutorial Source

This project is based on a tutorial from the YouTube channel [SOP 2](https://www.youtube.com/@Sop2), where I followed along to recreate the design.

## 🎯 My Goal

Learning how websites are built is an essential part of understanding how they can be tested and secured. This project marks an early milestone in my path toward becoming a professional in **Ethical Hacking** and **Information Security**.
